    <li>
      <p class="color-brown-light p-text-block">
        This may take you by surprise but the truth is: 
        you don't have to start learning the 44 or 45 
        consonant and vowel sounds.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="color-brown-light p-text-block">
        You also do not need to start learning how to transcribe or do any boring stuff of that sort.

  <p class="p-text-block">
    Learning what's mentioned in numbers 2 and 3 isn't a waste of time though but all I'm telling you is:

  <p class="bold p-text-block">
    I was able to speak like a native English speaker to the amazement of my friends and acquaintances without knowing all of those freaking boring things.

    Just a minute..

  <p class="bold p-text-block">
    My experience buying such course on Udemy made me realise that these white instructors on Udemy don't deeply understand what it takes for an African to speak the English language exactly like a native.
  </p>
  <p class="p-text-block">
    So I later found out that those courses can't help a typical Nigerian achieve the kind of results we've been talking about all the while.

    Teaching it to others is just one of the many ways to make 
    money from which you can start milking money from your 
    premium fluency.
  </p>
  <p class="bold p-text-block">
    You can equally use it to get any job of your dream or to attract high paying customers to your business. 
  </p>
  <p class="p-text-block">
    I said high paying customers simply because of the first things 
    people believe once you speak amazingly well is that: 
  </p>
  <p class="bold pri-color p-text-block">
    ‚Ä¢ Oh, this guy is so smart and intelligent
  </p>
  <p class="bold pri-color p-text-block">

    ‚Ä¢ He's financially okay
  </p>
  <p class="bold pri-color p-text-block">

    ‚Ä¢ He's highly skilled
  </p>
  <p class="bold pri-color p-text-block">

    ‚Ä¢ He's got the connections
  </p>
  <p class="bold pri-color p-text-block">

    ‚Ä¢ He should be living in an elite community, Lekki, Banana Island and the likes
  </p>
  <p class="bold pri-color p-text-block">
    ‚Ä¢ Maybe he's lived abroad before
  </p>
  <p class="bold pri-color p-text-block">
    ‚Ä¢ He must have a lot of opportunities out there. So let's sign the deal with him before someone else snatches him away from us.
  </p>
  <p class="p-text-block">
    Thoughts like these rush to us naturally. Hence this is what you too will think when you hear someone speak the English language exactly like a native.
  </p>
  <p class="p-text-block">
    The thought naturally drops in your head that the 
    speaker is just well-off.
  </p>
  <p class="p-text-block">
    Exactly what people will begin to think of you too and which will allow you to charge them whatever amount you want from them whenever they're hiring you.
  </p>
  <p class="bold p-text-block">
    Here's another student of mine, Abdullah Fawzaan, 
    a madrasah boy like myself who achieved the same 
    result in roughly a month and how his new mode of 
    speaking has been drawing people to his business..
